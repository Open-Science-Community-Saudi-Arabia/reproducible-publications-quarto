This is a two-days course by Open Science Community Saudi Arabia that will provide scientists with the complete foundation to master coding in R with more confidence, showing some basics and also some powerful things R can do. You’ll learn how to manipulate and visualise data using tidyverse and ggplot2. It’ll also introduce you to best practices in open science and Reproducibility using git and GitHub. . It allows users to add code, figures, citations, and bibliography, as well as to generate outputs in various formats (e.g., html, pdf, doc). Rstudio also connects with Git and Github and learners will have a chance to experiment with this integration and understand its advantages for collaboration and version control. This workshop will involve lectures and demos alternating with hands-on exercises and challenges, so by the end of the workshop, learners will have “authored” a reproducible paper of your own with the data and narrative we provide.
